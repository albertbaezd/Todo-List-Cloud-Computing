# Cloud Computing Final Project - Fordham University

Welcome to the Cloud Computing Final Project for Fordham University. This project showcases the power of modern cloud technologies by developing and deploying a dynamic todo list application.

## ðŸ’¡ Project Overview

This application is built with a **mobile-first** design using **React** for an intuitive and responsive user interface. It supports full **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage your tasks efficiently and also implements a module to export each task to a calendar of your preference such as **Outlook, Apple, Google and more**.

The backend is powered by Flask, ensuring smooth handling of your data, while the entire application is containerized with Docker and orchestrated using Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This setup guarantees scalability, reliability, and ease of deployment.
